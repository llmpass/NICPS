Introduction
============
Thanks for downloading glFont!  

glFont is a Win32 program that creates a texture containing a range of characters in a specified font, and automatically generates texture coordinates for use in OpenGL applications that need to display text.  The font type is not limited to monospaced fonts; each character is displayed with correct spacing and size.  

Text is rendered by texture mapping specific characters onto OpenGL quads.  It is quite possible and easy to modify the color, size, position of the text quads using standard OpenGL functions.  It is also quite possible to load as many different fonts as you wish, and use them whenever you please.

Terms of Use
============
You may use the source to the glFont API in any program you wish, commercial and non-commercial, as long as credit is given to myself (in the accompanying program documentation, or in the program itself), including my e-mail address and a link to my web page.  You may modify the source to fit your specific needs if wish, but the same terms apply--you must provide original credit to myself.
